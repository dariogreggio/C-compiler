# C-compiler

My glorious C-compiler, that started in 1989 using Acorn Basic on an Archimedes 310!!

It evolved during the years and now, despite its poor programming style (age, language, my skills at the time, and needed legacy ;) :) ) , is a very useful tool 
givem the crap that you find out there, nerdy stuff and bloated code!

In the beginning it would generate Basic code (embedding ARM instructions as online assembler) for the Acorn itself;
In 1994 I added Z80 for my Skynet Home automation boards;
In 2001 support for PIC 16 and 18 from Microchip;
Then some stuff for 8086 came (never completed)
In 2025 I added 68000 CPU!
