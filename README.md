# C-compiler

My glorious C-compiler, that started in 1989 using Acorn Basic on an Archimedes 310!!

It evolved during the years and now, despite its poor programming style (age, language, my skills at the time, and needed legacy ;) :) ) , is a very useful tool 
givem the crap that you find out there, nerdy stuff and bloated code!
